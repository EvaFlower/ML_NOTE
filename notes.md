## About use svm in nn
If using svm of sklearn in nn, there is no way to get the gradient from it. Use svm-loss instead.     
> As far as I know, SVM can only change its hyperplane without changing the input features. In other wordsï¼Œ
it only assumes that its hyperplane is not perfect and would not think that the input was wrong.
